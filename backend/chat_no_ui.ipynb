If a woman wants to terminate her pregnancy in a private setting, she can do so with the approval of the Committee for Termination of Pregnancy, but she will have to pay the doctor's salary herself. In some hospitals, no commitment is required, but it is necessary to check with the hospital whether a pledge is required.
