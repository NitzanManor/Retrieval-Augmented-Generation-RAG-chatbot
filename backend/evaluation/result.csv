No, clinical mammography is a medical examination that is only available to individuals who have a medical indication for it. If you don't have a medical need, you won't be eligible for this examination.

Where can you do it?

If you have a medical indication for clinical mammography, you can have it done at an institution under the agreement or in a public hospital. However, if you want to have the examination without a medical need, you can only do it at Asuta salons.

What should you do?

If you want to have clinical mammography without a medical need, you will need a referral from a Maccabi doctor. You will also need to deliver the medical referral and a letter of summons to the hospital to obtain a pledge.

Now, let's talk about the costs 🤑. For public transport, you'll get reimbursement for travel in 2 directions, in the amount of the transport fee according to the Ministry of Transport's website 📊. For a taxi ride, you'll get a full refund for travel in both directions, upon presenting the original receipt with a counter reading 📝. If the receipt doesn't have a counter reading, the refund will be calculated up to the fare ceiling as determined by the Ministry of Transport 📊.

For a private car, the calculation is a bit more complicated 🤔. It's NUMBER OF TREATMENTS X PRICE PER LITER OF OCTANE FUEL 95 INCLUDING SERVICE CHARGE X NO. KM, and then you divide the amount by 10 📊. And for an ambulance, you'll get a full refund for travel in both directions, according to the MDA fare, or from the actual price of the ambulance ride, which is the lower one 💸.

🏥 Unfortunately, you can't perform clinical mammography if you don't have a medical need. The insurance layers are Maccabi Shelli, Maccabi Gold, Maccabi Silver, and Basic Basket. Women and men who have a medical indication for this examination are eligible. The entitlement is a mammography examination, and it costs 36₪ quarterly deductible.

📍 The service is provided in institutions under the agreement, such as public hospitals under the agreement, Asuta salons, and institutes by agreement or in a public hospital. To obtain a pledge, a medical referral, and a letter of summons to the hospital must be delivered to Maccabi.

📝 Test results are usually available within a few hours, and the decoding of the test will be sent to the doctor in Maccabi within 5 working days. All Maccabi doctors can view results on a doctor's portal, and members can review the results on the Maccabi Online website and the Maccabi app.

📄 If you want to receive a copy of the examination disc, you can do so at any imaging institute of Maccabi. At Asuta institutes, you can receive copies of discs (second disc or later) for a fee.

Hey there! 🍔

So, you're wondering if you can perform clinical mammography even if you don't have any medical need? Well, the answer is yes, but there are some conditions to consider. 💡

First, you need to understand that clinical mammography is a unique X-ray of breast tissue that helps in early detection of breast cancer. It's not a routine checkup, but rather a medical indication for this examination. 🧑‍⚕️

If you're a woman, you can get a mammogram without a medical indication, but you'll need a referral from a family physician, women's doctor, or surgeon. 👩‍🦳

If you're a man, you can also get a mammogram without a medical indication, but you'll need a referral from a family physician or surgeon. 👨‍🦳

Now, let's talk about where you can get the mammogram. If you don't have a medical indication, you can only get a mammogram at Asuta salons. 🏥

If you have a medical indication, you can get a mammogram at any institution under the agreement, including public hospitals. 🏥

It's important to note that you'll need to deliver a medical referral and a letter of summons to the hospital to obtain a pledge. 📝

Once you've received the pledge, you'll need to wait for the test results. The degree of urgency will be determined by the X-ray/doctor, and the referring Macabbi doctor will receive the examination photographs within a few hours. 📝

The decoding of the test will be sent to the doctor in Maccabi within 5 working days, and all Maccabi doctors can view results on a doctor's portal. 📝

If you're getting a mammogram in a public hospital, you'll receive the results directly in front of the operating party, and you'll be responsible for the member who requests a disc of the examination. 📝

Hey there! 🍔

So, you're wondering if you can perform clinical mammography even if you don't have any medical need? Well, the answer is yes, but there are some conditions to consider. 💡

First, you need to understand that clinical mammography is a unique X-ray of breast tissue that helps in early detection of breast cancer. It's not a routine checkup, but rather a medical indication for this examination. 🧑‍⚕️

If you're a woman, you can get a mammogram without a medical indication, but you'll need a referral from a family physician, women's doctor, or surgeon. 👩‍🦳

If you're a man, you can also get a mammogram without a medical indication, but you'll need a referral from a family physician or surgeon. 👨‍🦳

Now, let's talk about where you can get the mammogram. If you don't have a medical indication, you can only get a mammogram at Asuta salons. 🏥

If you have a medical indication, you can get a mammogram at any institution under the agreement, including public hospitals. 🏥

It's important to note that you'll need to deliver a medical referral and a letter of summons to the hospital to obtain a pledge. 📝

Once you've received the pledge, you'll need to wait for the test results. The degree of urgency will be determined by the X-ray/doctor, and the referring Macabbi doctor will receive the examination photographs within a few hours. 📝

The decoding of the test will be sent to the doctor in Maccabi within 5 working days, and all Maccabi doctors can view results on a doctor's portal. 📝

If you're getting a mammogram in a public hospital, you'll receive the results directly in front of the operating party, and you'll be responsible for the member who requests a disc of the examination. 📝

If you're getting a mammogram in an institute by agreement or in a public hospital, you'll need to commit to the examination. 📝

Well, it's not a question, it's a statement,
But I'll give you a rhyme, just for the sake of it,
In accordance with the law, it's allowed,
For a person with a disability, to be served,
With a service animal by their side,
It's a right, not something to hide.

So, if you're a member of Maccabi,
And you have a service animal, don't be shy,
You're entitled to admission to health facilities,
Except for places that are not obliged to allow it,
But even then, your animal can stay,
In an adequate facility, while you're being treated.

So, bring your furry friend, don't be afraid,
You'll be treated with care, and not made to wait,
Just remember to present a certificate or marking,
And your service animal will be allowed to enter, without any disruption.",0.686636509,0.56221217,0.845529414,"{'precision': 0.6, 'recall': 1.0, 'f1': 0.75}",0.6,1,0.75,
