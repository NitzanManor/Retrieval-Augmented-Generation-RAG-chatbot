Bring to the pool visit the following forms:
Referral form from the Physiotherapy Institute for Water Treatment.
Diagnostic form from an attending physician. permission from a doctor to enter water at a temperature of 34 degrees.
Form of obligation to pay from the cash register (form 17). In the event that you have chosen a pool in agreement with rebates, it is not necessary to bring a pledge form.
What else is worth knowing?
If, at the end of the course of treatment, the pool therapist recommended another series of treatments, you should contact the medical center office with the request for confirmation. The application will be directed by the medical center to the district physiotherapist or to the authorized representative.
The decision to continue or terminate treatment will be made at the professional discretion of the physiotherapist in Maccabi.
If you chose a pool by agreement with a pledge - you must get it from the office of the medical center.
If you chose a pool in agreement with refunds - you must submit to the medical center office an original receipt and tax invoice to receive a refund.
