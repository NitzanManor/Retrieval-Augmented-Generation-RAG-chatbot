What should you do?
Getting a referral from an orthopedist for a cast is easy. In most cases, the decision is made only after the affected organ has been plastered with a regular cast.
Arrive at the Maccabi Pharm branch with the referral, and order the plaster according to the dimensions specified in the order.
You must pay at the moment of booking.
Maccabi Pharm will contact you within a few days and invite you to receive the light cast.
Make an appointment with an orthopedist for the operation of the gibus, after receiving the light cast.
