To locate complementary therapists in the agreement

What should you do?
Get a referral from a pediatrician, family doctor, child psychiatrist/psychiatrist, pediatric neurologist or from the Maccabi Child Development Unit. It is important to make sure that the referral has been received and registered in the office of the medical center, and that the appropriate treatment code is recorded in the system.
Some suppliers require a pledge (highlighted in the list). To receive a pledge, the referral must be submitted to the medical center by fax, email, or through the Maccabi Online website to receive a pledge. The commitment is given for a limited number of treatments, so the pledge must be renewed when the previous one has expired. In the transition between calendar years, a doctor referral and engagement must be renewed.
