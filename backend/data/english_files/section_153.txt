Foam Injection Treatments for Vein and Varicose Problems - One-Sided

 During the treatment, a foamy substance is injected, which causes a kind of inflammation of the vein and, as a result, its clogging. Clogging of the vein causes the disappearance of varicose veins and the redirection of venous blood flow in alternative ways along the limb.
