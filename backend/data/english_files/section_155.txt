To locate complementary therapists in the agreement

What should you do?
Consult a pediatrician or family doctor for an initial diagnosis. According to the diagnosis, it will be decided whether it is necessary to refer to some diagnoses at the Institute of Child Development (such as speech therapy, physiotherapy or occupational therapy) or only referral to occupational therapy.
After receiving the referral from the doctor, you need to fill out a questionnaire according to the age of the child and pass a designated questionnaire to the kindergartner/teacher. IF THE REFERRAL IS FOR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY, THE QUESTIONNAIRE “PARTICIPATION OF THE CHILD IN DAY-TO-DAY OCCUPATIONS” MUST ALSO BE FILLED OUT. 
Send the questionnaires to the appropriate institute. Submission of all relevant questionnaires is a prerequisite in receiving treatment for referral.
Receive the diagnostic report from the attending physician, after receiving it from the Institute of Child Development, on the Maccabi Online website. The diagnosis must be printed and brought to the therapist where the treatments will be performed.
Complementary Treatments
GET A REFERRAL FROM A PEDIATRICIAN, FAMILY, PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGIST OR STAFF MEMBER BELONGING TO MACCABI'S CHILD DEVELOPMENT UNIT. It is important to make sure that the referral has been received and registered in the office of the medical center, and that the appropriate treatment code is recorded in the system.
Submit the referral to the medical center by fax, email or through Maccabi Online to receive a commitment. The commitment is given for a limited number of treatments, so you must renew the commitment when the previous one has expired. In the transition between calendar years, a pledge must be renewed again.

What else is worth knowing?
Addition treatments are for a calendar year. Treatments cannot be transferred from one calendar year to another.
The child's parents can decide on a transition from one treatment to another, but still the total number of treatments that come to the child in a calendar year will be 50.
In order to realize the eligibility under Maccabi Shelli framework, you must first utilize the entire quota of treatments provided within the basic basket.
Treatment should be reached with a magnetic card.
