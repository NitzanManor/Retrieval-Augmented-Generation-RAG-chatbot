GET A REFERRAL FROM A PEDIATRICIAN, FAMILY, PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGIST OR STAFF MEMBER BELONGING TO MACCABI'S CHILD DEVELOPMENT UNIT. It is important to make sure that the referral has been received and registered in the office of the medical center, and that the appropriate treatment code is recorded in the system.
Submit the referral to the medical center by fax, email or through Maccabi Online to receive a commitment. The commitment is given for a limited number of treatments, so you must renew the commitment when the previous one has expired. In the transition between calendar years, a pledge must be renewed again.

What else is worth knowing?
Eligibility is also valid for children defined by the Institute of Child Development as somatically-autistic.
Maccabi institutes provide a variety of treatments and diagnoses, but in certain situations the institute will turn to other places for treatment. The process of exercising eligibility is determined accordingly.
Institutes with an agreement: If the Maccabi Institute decides to refer the child for diagnosis or treatment outside the Maccabi Institutes, the parents will be referred to the branch office for a pledge.
