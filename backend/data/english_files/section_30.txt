REHABILITATIVE HOSPITALIZATION
The choice of the inpatient institution will be made at the discretion of the professional and in accordance with the instructions of the staff attending the Department of Health Services. Exceptional cases will be examined by the district medical director.
Members who have been discharged from complex nursing care and have not used the full 60 days they are entitled to from “Maccabi Silver”, “Maccabi Gold” or “Maccabi Shelli”, can use the remaining days of hospitalization if they need additional hospitalization during the same year.
It is possible to contact the Maccabi Medical Center to inquire about the discounts on self-participation due to financial distress.
All of the above is subject to the additional health care regulations in Maccabi.
