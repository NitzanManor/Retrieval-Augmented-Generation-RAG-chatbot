Endocrinal/Dynamic Test

 When conducting an endocrine examination, clinical suspicion of an excess or deficiency of hormones sometimes arises. In some cases, an endocrine test should be performed to diagnose an excess or lack of a hormone. During the test, the changes in the concentrations of hormones in the blood under the influence of a drug or other stimulus are measured by taking blood at specified times according to the instructions of the referring endocrinologist doctor. There are different types of tests, such as a test for growth hormone or glucagon. At the time of the test, you will be asked to stay in the clinic until the end of the test (several hours).
