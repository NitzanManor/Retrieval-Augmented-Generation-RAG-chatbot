If 2 children are born before the end of 5 years, Maccabi will stop the right to save sperm
At the end of 5 years, the condition will be re-evaluated, according to 2 doses of semen

For fertility treatments
The sperm that will be frozen will be used as part of the treatments carried out during that time.
