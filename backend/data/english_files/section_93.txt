For the first treatment - contact a licensed fertility doctor. It is the responsibility of the dedicated Malatops and to deliver it directly to the National Center of Maccabi for Productivity Certifications.
Follow-up treatments - It is the responsibility of the doctor to fill out and send a follow-up care form to the National Center of Maccabi for fertility certificates.

Purchase of prion drugs
Eligibility does not include the cost of purchasing prion drugs.
Prion drugs can be purchased until the age of 44 (until the date of the 45th birthday).
Before contacting the pharmacy for the purchase of drugs, you must obtain a certificate of undertaking a + B treatment cycle.
You must print the approved pledge so that an authorization for medicines is opened at the pharmacy.
The validity of the drug approval is six months and is shortened to 45 days from the date of the first purchase.
Stage C (embryo recovery) - a stage that does not require medication. In exceptional situations where drug treatment is required, the fertility doctor must deliver a medical letter to the IVF Fertility Certification Center. 
QUANTITATIVE CONTROL - IN MACCABI PHARM THERE IS A QUANTITATIVE CONTROL MECHANISM FOR THE PURCHASE OF PRION DRUGS.
If the issuance of drugs beyond the prescribed amount for treatment is required, you will receive at Maccabi Pharm a dedicated form for the fertility doctor, which he will submit for approval from the IVF Fertility Certification Center.
Application for Extension of Medicines to Phase A+B
Up to 7 days from the expiration of the drug authorization (45 days) - an original prescription signed by the fertility doctor is required. On top of the prescription should be written that this is a continuation of treatment of the same treatment cycle.
Beyond 7 days from the expiration of the drug approval (45 +7) — it is the responsibility of the fertility doctor to deliver to the IVF Fertility Certification Center a medical letter that indicates the need for prolongation of the validity of the drugs.

This entitlement is also provided in the route of a surrogacy procedure in which there is a medical certificate signed by a specialist who is authorized to issue such a certificate that the woman cannot conceive or pregnancy is dangerous for her.
When it comes to egg donation, the eligibility for the stages of IVF will be in accordance with the rules of the basket or additional health services, and according to the age of the woman.
In the event that the patient's spouse is not a member of Maccabi, his treatment will be funded by his hospital fund.
